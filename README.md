# DWH and analytics project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! üöÄ
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse & implementing Slow-changing-dimension type 2 to track the change in source and to generate actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

## üìä Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold layers**
![Alt Text](docs/Data_Architecture.png)


1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database by ***PySpark Job***.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis by ***PySpark Job***.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
